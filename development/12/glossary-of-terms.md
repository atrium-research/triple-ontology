## Semantic Artefact Resource Type

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| `schema:ContactPoint` | A contact point for a person or organization providing information about the semantic artifact. |
| `mod:SemanticArtefact` | A semantic artifact from the MOD ontology representing formal knowledge representations. |
| `triple:SemanticArtefact` | A structured knowledge representation such as an ontology, vocabulary, taxonomy, or concept scheme used in SSH research, extending mod:SemanticArtefact. |
| `schema:contactPoint` | A relationship linking the semantic artifact to contact information for administrative purposes. |
| `schema:creativeWorkStatus` | The lifecycle status of the semantic artifact (e.g., draft, published, deprecated). |
| `schema:abstract` | An abstract or summary describing the semantic artifact's purpose and content. |
| `schema:headline` | The primary title or name of the semantic artifact. |
| `schema:datePublished` | The date when the semantic artifact was first published or made available. |
| `schema:dateModified` | The date when the semantic artifact was last modified or updated. |
| `schema:version` | A version identifier for the semantic artifact indicating its evolution or revision. |
| `schema:fileFormat` | The physical file format expressed as a MIME type (e.g., application/rdf+xml, text/turtle, application/zip). |
| `schema:encodingFormat` | The representation technique or methodology used to structure the semantic content (e.g., OWL ontology, SKOS vocabulary, XML schema). |
| `schema:keywords` | Keywords or tags used to describe the semantic artifact content. |
| `dcterms:isReferencedBy` | A related resource that references, cites, or otherwise points to the semantic artifact. |
| `triple:ID` | Platform identifier class for internal semantic artifact management within GoTriple, subclass of datacite:Identifier. |
| `triple:PID` | Persistent identifier class generated by GoTriple platform for external exposure of semantic artifacts, subclass of datacite:Identifier. |
| `triple:OriginalIdentifier` | Original identifier class from source system where semantic artifact was harvested, subclass of datacite:Identifier. |

| `datacite:Identifier` | Base class for all identifiers following DataCite specification. |
| `datacite:IdentifierScheme` | A standardized system for creating and managing identifiers in DataCite. |
| `datacite:hasIdentifier` | DataCite property connecting semantic artifacts to their identifiers. |
| `datacite:usesIdentifierScheme` | DataCite property connecting identifiers to their schemes (inferred automatically for typed identifiers). |
