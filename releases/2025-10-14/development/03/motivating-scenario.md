## Description

### General description

The life cycle and creation of a document in GoTriple involve various roles, each playing a significant part in its development, dissemination, and maintenance. These roles, which can be assumed by either organizations or individuals, are fluid and may change over time. They include:

1. **Author**: The individual or group primarily responsible for creating the content of the document. Authors are the intellectual source of the research and ideas presented in the document.

2. **Contributor**: These are individuals or entities that have played a significant, but not primary, role in the creation of the document. Their contributions can be in various forms, such as providing data, writing assistance, or other forms of support.

3. **Publisher**: The publisher is responsible for the distribution and dissemination of the document. This role often involves tasks such as editing, design, marketing, and ensuring the document reaches its intended audience.

4. **Provider**: This refers to the entity that makes the document available within the GoTriple platform. Providers may be different from the original publishers, especially in cases where documents are sourced from third-party databases or repositories.

5. **Producer**: The producer is typically responsible for the technical aspects of creating the document, which might include formatting, typesetting, or the production of physical copies in the case of printed materials.

6. **Aggregator**: An aggregator in the context of GoTriple collates various documents from different sources. This role is crucial for enhancing the platform's database by bringing together diverse SSH resources from multiple origins.

7. **Primary Producer**: This is the original source or creator of the document, often before it undergoes processing or publishing. The primary producer is usually responsible for the initial creation and compilation of the content.

8. **Funder**: Funders are individuals or organizations that provide financial support for the creation, research, or publication of the document. Their role is vital in enabling the research and dissemination process, especially in academic and scholarly contexts.

Each of these roles contributes to the lifecycle of a document in GoTriple, from its initial creation to its eventual dissemination and use. This dynamic ecosystem ensures that documents are not only rich in content but also supported by a network of contributors and facilitators, enhancing the overall value and accessibility of SSH resources on the GoTriple platform.

### Technical specification

In a technical framework like GoTriple, the role system for document creation and lifecycle management is defined by three key parameters: the temporal collocation, the associated entities (persons or organizations), and the specific functions or responsibilities of each role.

1. **Temporal Collocation**: 
   - Each role is aligned with a specific phase in the document's lifecycle. This temporal placement defines when a particular role is active and influential in the process of document creation, modification, dissemination, or preservation.
   - The lifecycle phases typically include the initial creation or conceptualization phase, the development or production phase, the publication or release phase, and the archival or preservation phase.

2. **Associated Entities**:
   - Roles can be assumed by individuals such as researchers, writers, and technical experts, or by organizations including academic institutions, publishing houses, data repositories, and funding bodies.
   - The entity associated with a role may vary based on the nature of the document, the field of study, and the resources available for the project.

3. **Role Specification**:
   - Each role comes with a set of specific functions or responsibilities that contribute to the document's development.

In this role system, the interplay between the temporal collocation, the entities involved, and their specified roles ensures a dynamic yet structured progression of a document from its inception to its ultimate utilization and archiving. This systematic approach is crucial in managing the complex processes involved in the handling of scholarly and research documents, particularly in a multifaceted platform like GoTriple.

## Example 1

`document_1` has as author the individual `author_34`, as provider the organization `provider_9` in `2012` and the organization `provider_45` in `2022`.
