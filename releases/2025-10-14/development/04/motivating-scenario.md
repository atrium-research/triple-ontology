Subjects coverage

## Description

### General description
In the GoTriple platform, documents must have metadata associated with the subjects discussed in the article content. This need arises for two reasons: the data retrieved from the data providers had these entities. To facilitate the search of documents through metadata.
Having metadata, and thus entities, that manage the subjects covered by a document are highly effective tools in search and filtering.
Three types of metadata are used to describe subject coverage: temporal coverage, spatial coverage and keywords.

Temporal coverage refers to the time span or historical period to which the document content refers. 
This can be a specific date.
It allows users to understand the historical context or specific period relevant to the research or discussion 
presented in the document. 
discussion presented in the paper. This time aspect is useful for researchers focusing on historical trends, 
chronological analyses or specific time studies.

Spatial coverage refers to the geographical focus or area of relevance of the document. 
This may be a country, a region, a city or even a specific location that is central to the content of the document.
This geographical aspect is useful in understanding the regional relevance or geographical scope of the information or research presented. 
It is especially important for studies that are location-specific or when researchers are interested in SSH resources related to specific geographical areas.

Keywords are words that capture the essence of the document, making the article more easily searchable and filterable through special search filters. 
Each document can have one or more associated keywords.
