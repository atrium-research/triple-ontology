## [Unreleased]

### 2025-10-23 - Iteration 01: Addition of Core Descriptive Metadata and URL Identifiers

**Type**: Addition

**Description**:
Enhanced Iteration 01 with essential descriptive metadata properties (title, abstract, format) and comprehensive URL identifier support using DataCite pattern for consistency.

**Details**:

**Part 1 - Core Descriptive Metadata**:
- **New properties added**:
  - `schema:headline` - Document title (multilingual, rdf:langString)
  - `schema:abstract` - Document abstract/summary (multilingual, rdf:langString)
  - `schema:encodingFormat` - File format as MIME type (xsd:string)
- **TBOX updates**: Added three new data properties with cardinality restrictions on `triple:Document`
- **ABOX examples**:
  - `document_1` with bilingual title/abstract (English & French) + PDF format
  - `document_31` with English title/abstract + HTML format
- **Competency questions**: Added 5 new questions (CQ_1.8 to CQ_1.12) with corresponding SPARQL queries
- **Coverage impact**: 70.8% (17/24) → 83.3% (20/24)

**Part 2 - URL Identifier Support**:
- **New IdentifierSchemes**:
  - `triple:landing_page_url` - Landing page with metadata and descriptive information
  - `triple:full_text_url` - Direct access to full document content
  - `triple:source_url` - Original publication location or source repository
- **Design decision**: Used DataCite Identifier pattern instead of Schema.org direct properties (`schema:url`, `schema:mainEntityOfPage`, `schema:isBasedOnURL`) to maintain consistency with DOI, ISBN, ISSN, Handle identifiers
- **ABOX examples**: Added 3 URL identifiers to `document_1`:
  - Landing page: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-12345
  - Full text: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-12345/document
  - Source: https://journals.openedition.org/dh/12345
- **Competency questions**: Added 2 new questions (CQ_1.13, CQ_1.14) with SPARQL queries for URL retrieval
- **Coverage impact**: 83.3% (20/24) → **95.8% (23/24)**

**Files Modified**:
- `development/01/TBOX.ttl` - Added 3 data properties with restrictions
- `development/01/ABOX.ttl` - Added 3 IdentifierSchemes + 3 URL identifiers + metadata examples
- `development/01/motivating-scenario.md` - Updated technical specification and Example 1
- `development/01/informal-competency-questions.md` - Added 7 new questions (CQ_1.8 to CQ_1.14)
- `development/01/formal-competency-questions.md` - Added 7 SPARQL queries
- `development/01/glossary-of-terms.md` - Added 6 new terms

**Rationale**:
The DataCite approach for URLs ensures architectural consistency, strong typing, and alignment with scholarly publishing standards used by major SSH repositories (HAL, Zenodo, OpenAIRE). This pattern allows distinguishing between different URL types while maintaining the same structure as academic identifiers.

### 2025-10-23 - Iteration 06: Refactoring to Remove PRO Ontology References

**Type**: Refactoring

**Description**:
Completely refactored Iteration 06 to remove all references to the PRO (Publishing Roles Ontology) and updated the author profile model to use Schema.org and FOAF properties directly.

**Details**:
- **Removed PRO ontology**: Eliminated all references to `pro:RoleInTime`, `pro:withRole`, `pro:isHeldBy`, `pro:isDocumentContextFor`
- **Updated model**: Documents now link directly to author profiles using `schema:author` property
- **Profile claiming mechanism**: Profiles can be "claimed" or "unclaimed" based on presence of `foaf:account` property
- **Name decomposition**: Added `schema:givenName` and `schema:familyName` to all profiles for better name disambiguation
- **Realistic examples**: Replaced generic placeholder names with realistic examples:
  - Example 1: John Smith / J. Smith (name variation disambiguation)
  - Example 2: Maria Rossi with 3 variants (Maria Rossi, M. Rossi, Maria R. Rossi) + Pierre Dupont (unclaimed)
  - Example 3: Single user account claiming multiple profile variations
- **Documentation updates**:
  - Completely rewritten glossary (15 terms) removing PRO concepts
  - Updated motivating scenario with clear technical specification
  - Enhanced all 5 informal competency questions
  - Added new CQ_6.6 for givenName/familyName queries
  - Added new CQ_6.9 SPARQL query for filtering by family name
- **Updated formal competency questions**: All SPARQL queries now use `schema:author` instead of PRO patterns

**Files Modified**:
- `development/06/glossary-of-terms.md` - Completely rewritten (removed 6 PRO terms, added 15 correct terms)
- `development/06/motivating-scenario.md` - Technical specification and all 3 examples rewritten
- `development/06/informal-competency-questions.md` - All 5 questions updated + 1 new question added
- `development/06/ABOX.ttl` - Added givenName/familyName to all 5 profiles with realistic names
- `development/06/formal-competency-questions.md` - Updated expected results + 1 new SPARQL query
- `development/05/formal-competency-questions.md` - Removed PRO prefix, updated CQ_5.2
- `development/07/motivating-scenario.md` - Removed PRO pattern description

**Design Decision**:
Simplified author attribution by using direct `schema:author` links instead of complex role-in-time patterns. The claiming mechanism (presence/absence of `foaf:account`) provides clearer semantics for claimed vs unclaimed profiles.

**Competency Questions**: 9 total (was 8, added 1 for name decomposition)

### 2025-10-23 - Refactoring: Introduction of triple:Document

**Type**: Refactoring

**Description**:
Major refactoring to introduce `triple:Document` class in the TRIPLE namespace with dual inheritance pattern, replacing incorrect usage of `foaf:Document` throughout all iterations.

**Details**:
- **Main Change**: Defined `triple:Document` as subclass of both `schema:CreativeWork` and `foaf:Document`
  - Establishes dual inheritance pattern for semantic interoperability
  - Resolves namespace ownership issues (TRIPLE ontology now owns its Document class)
  - Maintains compatibility with both Schema.org and FOAF vocabularies
- **Iteration 01**: Foundational `triple:Document` definition with labels, comments, and restrictions for document types, identifiers, and languages
- **Iteration 02**: Expanded controlled vocabularies with 4 complete examples (License, Access Conditions, Document Type, Discipline) including real external matches to COAR, Creative Commons, and Library of Congress; added 10 informal and 12 formal competency questions; corrected `skos:definition` from `owl:DatatypeProperty` to `owl:AnnotationProperty` (SKOS compliance)
- **Iteration 03**: Updated property domains and 2 document instances
- **Iteration 04**: Updated property domains and class definitions
- **Iteration 05**: Simplified to focus only on Cluster and isDiscarded functionality (removed redundant definitions from previous iterations following SAMOD best practices)
- **Iteration 06**: Added `triple:Document` with author profile restrictions, updated 5 document instances
- **Iteration 08**: Added `triple:Document` with `dc:type` restrictions, updated 2 document instances
- **Iteration 09**: Added `triple:Document` with `schema:conditionsOfAccess` restrictions, updated 3 document instances

### 2025-10-05 - Iteration 11: Document Mentions and References

**Type**: Addition

**Description**:
Added support for documents to mention other entities (documents, people, projects, organizations) using the Schema.org `schema:mentions` property.

**Details**:
- Implemented generic mentions functionality using `schema:mentions` property
- Documents can mention various types of entities:
  - **Other Documents** (`foaf:Document`) - citations and bibliographic references
  - **People** (`foaf:Person`) - researchers or scholars discussed in the text
  - **Projects** (`schema:Project`) - research projects referenced or evaluated
  - **Organizations** (`foaf:Organization`) - institutions or research centers mentioned
- Established explicit compatibility: `foaf:Document rdfs:subClassOf schema:CreativeWork`

## Previous Development (Iterations 01-07)

The initial seven iterations of the TRIPLE ontology were developed following SAMOD methodology, covering:

1. **Iteration 01**: GoTriple Document basics (types, languages, identifiers, metadata)
2. **Iteration 02**: Controlled vocabularies (license, access conditions, document types, disciplines)
3. **Iteration 03**: Document roles (author, contributor, publisher, provider, funder, etc.)
4. **Iteration 04**: Subject coverage (temporal, spatial, keywords)
5. **Iteration 05**: Duplicate handling (document clusters) and discarded entities (flagged authors/keywords)
6. **Iteration 06**: Author profiles and user accounts (disambiguation, claimed/unclaimed profiles)
7. **Iteration 07**: Projects (SSH research projects with metadata, roles, subjects)

**Base ontology established**:
- Namespace: `https://gotriple.eu/ontology/triple#`
- Format: RDF/Turtle
- External standards integrated: FOAF, Dublin Core, DataCite, Schema.org, SKOS, SPAR

---

## Notes

- All changes follow the SAMOD (Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development) three-phase cycle
- Each iteration includes: motivating scenario, competency questions (informal and formal), glossary, TBOX, ABOX, and diagrams
- Competency questions are tested with SPARQL queries against instance data
- Visual documentation uses Graffoo notation for OWL ontologies
